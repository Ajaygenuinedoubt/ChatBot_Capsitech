# Personal Chatbot

## Overview
This project is a **Personal AI Chatbot** built using **Llama-2** and **Streamlit**, providing an interactive chatbot experience. The chatbot leverages **Llama Index** and **LangChain** to manage conversation history and generate responses efficiently.

## Features
- Uses **Llama-2-7B** for AI-driven conversation.
- **Streamlit-based UI** for easy interaction.
- **Supports Markdown responses**.
- **Clearing conversation history** with a single click.
- **Efficient response generation** using GPU-accelerated inference.
